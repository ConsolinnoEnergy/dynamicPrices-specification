Introduction
------------

This document describes the format of a JSON object used for dynamic pricing data in compliance with the CLSEEDI (Common Local Smart Energy Exchange Data Interface) specification. This data structure provides time-based electricity price information in a standardized format.


Topics:

To set dynamic price data:

Fields Description
------------------

type:
    Indicates the type of data. In this case, "de.dynamicprice" specifies that the object contains dynamic price information.

source:
    This field is reserved for identifying the origin of the data. It should be populated with information about the data source, such as the provider or system generating this data.

id:
    A unique identifier for this message instance, using a UUID format. This ID ensures that each message can be distinctly recognized.

specversion:
    Specifies the version of the data specification being used. Here, "1.0" indicates the first version of the CLSEEDI dynamic pricing format.

data:
    Contains the main payload of the message:

    protocol:
        Indicates the protocol version being used, "1.0.0" in this case.

    errorNumber:
        A numerical code representing the error status. A value of 0 indicates no errors; other values would indicate different error conditions.

    daPrices:
        An array of objects representing day-ahead prices:

        time:
            A timestamp in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) indicating when the price is effective. The 'Z' at the end denotes that the time is in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).

        value:
            The price in euros per megawatt-hour (€/MWh). For example, a value of 92.93 means 92.93 €/MWh. This can be interpreted in smaller units as follows:
            - 92.93 €/MWh translates to 9293 cent per 1000 kWh.
            - This further simplifies to approximately 9.29 cent per kWh.

Important Notes
---------------

- Time Format: The time must be in the exact UTC format as specified (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ), which ensures compatibility and accurate scheduling for energy pricing.

- Price Interpretation: Prices are expressed as double precision floating-point numbers in euros per megawatt-hour, reflecting the cost of electricity for the specified time periods.
